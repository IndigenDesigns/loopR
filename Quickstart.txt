QUICKSTART INSTALLATION AND OPERATION

1. Unpack the distribution in your home directory.

> cd
> tar -zxf loopRxxx.tgz

If you put it somewhere else you will want to change the client path. See below.

2. Build the executables

Do 'make' from parent directory to make everything.

> cd loopR
> make

These executables will be built with make: 
  ./engine/loopR
  ./frontend/imgui/client
  ./server/server

3. Set up ~/.loopR

Create ~/.loopR ( $HOME/.loopR ). Copy the *.zz files from the distribution top
directory into ~/.loopR .  These are the internal metronome sound files.

> mkdir ~/.loopR
> cp *.zz ~/.loopR

If you want to change any setup parameters for the engine, they will be in
~./loopR/config. This file will be created with defaults the first time loopR
is run.

4(a).   Start the engine and client

> ./engine/loopR


OR

4(b).	Start the server, engine and client

On one machine start the server application.

> ./server/server &

Start a client engine to initialize the server then quit ( do this once ):

> ./engine/loopR -H -i

Then start multiple pairs of engine and client ( these will need to be on
different physical hosts. First modify the TRACKHOST address in the
configuration file for these clients )

> ./engine/loopR -Hyourclientname
